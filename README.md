# üëã Hello, I'm Keling Yue

I'm an aspiring full-stack data scientist with hands-on experience in LLM applications, A/B testing, and data pipeline development ‚Äî with a focus on the finance and sustainable energy sectors.

## üéì Education

- **Master's in [Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/)**

  - University of Chicago
  - CS department + Public Policy department

- **B.S. in Finance**

  - Central University of Finance and Economics, China
  - Focus: Quantitative Finance

## üë©‚Äçüíª Projects

### Stream Processing

- **[Real-Time Stream Processing Pipeline for Financial Data](https://github.com/keling888/finnhub_stream)**: This project builds an end-to-end real-time financial data pipeline using Google BigQuery, Apache Kafka, PySpark, and Grafana. The system extracts real-time data from Finnhub.io and batch data from the Federal Reserve, transforms stock market and interest rate data, loads it into a data warehouse (BigQuery), visualizes the data on Grafana dashboards (updated every 500ms), and sets up alerts for specific market conditions.

### Batch Processing - ETL

- **Product to Analysis: ETL pipeline for an online experiment app**: Designed, implemented and automated data pipeline from MongoDB to data warehouse. Implemented STAR schema models for database design.

- **[Bus Pending](https://github.com/uchicago-mscapp-projects/bus_pending)**: Bus Pending collects and analyzes high-frequency location data of Chicago's public buses to better understand how often buses are delayed, and for whom delays occur. It combines live bus position data with bus schedules and demographic information on Chicago buses. These data are displayed in a live dashboard.

### Cloud Infrastructure

- **AWS Data Platform for Genomic Annotation Service**: Builds a scalable platform for a genomic annotation app on AWS.
  - Supports direct S3 uploads and downloads via presigned URLs
  - Microservices architecture: Flask web server, annotation engine, and utilities engine, all deployed on EC2
  - Event-driven workflow powered by AWS SQS and SNS
  - DynamoDB for job status tracking
  - Cost-efficient data lifecycle management with AWS Glacier, Step Functions and Lambda

### Machine Learning & NLP

- **[AI Industry Impact Analysis](https://github.com/keling888/nlp_news)**: Using ~200K news articles, this project fine-tuned a RoBERTa model for sentiment analysis with VADER and BLOOM method for labeling and simulation. The fine-tuned model achieves 82% macro-F1 score. Performed LDA and PCA-based topic modeling: identified top 4 industries positively affected by AI.

- **Fake News Detection**: Designed and implemented TF-IDF + logistic regression, Random Forest and BERT based fake news detection systems.
